# GradeCalculator
A repo designed to hold my grade calculator files.

Original idea was to calculate my grades in university. The code you see in C currently is my code from my time in ENEE140 (spring 2024).

I will continue to work on this with an actual grade calculator polished and everything on my Linux testbench.

Hopefully this proves beneficial to anyone out there.
Best of luck
