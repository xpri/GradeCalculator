# **GradeCalculator**
A program designed to calculate your final grade; displays all output into the command-line. It only calculates one specific class. You must be precise with all numbers as you cannot go back (working towards mitigating that).

I will continue to work on this with an actual grade calculator polished and everything on my Linux testbench.

Original idea was to calculate my grades in university. The code you see in the OUTDATED_GradeCalculator folder was a grade calculator project from my time in ENEE140 (spring 2024).

Hopefully this proves beneficial to anyone out there.

Best of luck
